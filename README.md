In this assignment the objective was to create a responsive quiz over javascript fundamentals with a score counter and timer. This required creating global variables for each compenant of the quiz such as the time, buttons, score, questions, and answers. The questions and answers were held in an array of objects that would be referenced in the renderQuestion function that initaited the start of the quiz. The quiz was also randomized meaning that the user would have a different order of questions each button click. When an answer was selected the checkAnswer function would run and evaluate the stored click value from the event listener and then either alert the question was correct and add to the score counter or say it was wrong and deduct 10 seconds from the timer. The game was over when all questions were answered or the timer hit 0. The user was then prompted to enter their initals and submit their quiz to save their score in local storage.
